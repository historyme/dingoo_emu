# dingoo_emu

## HLE
dingoo_emu is a HLE. The goal is to simulate the dingoo app.

## USE unicorn framework
At the beginning, I tried using the Unicorn framework to simulate. But the efficiency is relatively low.
So, I later transplanted the IRJIT of ppsspp, which performed very well.

## USE PPSSPP mips IRJIT

## UCOSII multi-task 

## mixer

## SDL2 front-end

## VS2022

## Other tools
1. capstone framework
2. keystone framework

## Reference project
1. ppsspp
2. vmrp
